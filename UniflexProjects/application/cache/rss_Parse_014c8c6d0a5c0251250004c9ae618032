										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="story-body-text" data-para-word-count="23">THE <a href="http://zimra.co.zw">Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (Zimra)</a> has started executing its recently added mandate of deducting mining royalties, through banking institutions, on behalf of the Treasury.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" data-para-word-count="29">The Zimbabwe tax authority said yesterday all mining entities and individuals should start complying with the new requirements for remitting mining royalties with effect from the 27th of last month.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" data-para-word-count="31">Payment of mining royalties through Zimra is meant to make it easier for miners to remit royalties as the <a href="https://miningzimbabwe.com/tag/minerals-marketing-corporation-of-zimbabwe-mmcz/">Minerals Marketing Corporation of Zimbabwe (MMCZ)</a> remains under US illegal economic sanctions.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" data-para-word-count="37">MMCZ was one of 16 entities placed under ruinous economic sanctions by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in 2008 over spurious allegations of contributing to undermining of democratic procedures and institutions in Zimbabwe.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" data-para-word-count="27">The parastatal is the sole marketing agent for all Zimbabwean mineral exports except gold and silver. The OFAC can seize payments to any entities under US embargoes.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" data-para-word-count="38">The US imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe in 2001 after joining on the side of the British Government that was fighting the country over unfilled bilateral issues that resulted in Zimbabwe embarking on a highly success land reform programme.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" data-para-word-count="36">While other state entities, among them Industrial Development Corporation, ZB Holdings and Agriculture Finance Corporation (ex-Agribank) had sanctions lifted, MMCZ remained under the embargo probable because the role it plays in marketing the country&#8217;s mineral resources.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" data-para-word-count="36">&#8220;All mineral exporters and financial institutions are hereby advised that, with effect from May 27, 2021, the responsibility to deduct and remit mining royalties to the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority shall be through financial institutions,&#8221; Zimra said.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" data-para-word-count="34">A mining royalty is a sovereign right to receive payment based on a percentage of the value of mineral exported. Mining royalties are deducted as a percentage of the gross value of minerals shipped.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" data-para-word-count="36">Diamonds and other precious stones are taxed at 10 percent, platinum 2,5 percent, other precious metals 4 percent, base and industrial metals 2 percent, coal 1 percent, black granite and other uncut dimensional stones 2 percent.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" data-para-word-count="31">Zimra said banks will deduct mining royalties from payments received for mineral exports by mining firms or exporting persons, by crediting the business partner&#8217;s royalties account or receiver of the exports.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" data-para-word-count="32">Authorised financial institutions shall remit deducted amounts on or before the 10th day of each month, following the month in which the deduction was made, the tax authority said in a statement.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" data-para-word-count="36">When remitting the royalties, banking institutions will be required to prepare and submit a schedule of payments to the national tax authority on or before the 10th day of each month when the deduction was made.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" data-para-word-count="37">&#8220;&#8216;The mineral exporters shall be required to complete the return REV 5C and submit to Zimra on or before the 10th day of the month following the month in which they were deducted,&#8217; the tax collector said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Dinde community leader, Never Tshuma will appear at the Hwange Magistrate court today facing charges of inciting public violence in his quest to stop Chinese company <a href="https://miningzimbabwe.com/chinese-miner-breaks-silence-on-dinde-project/">Beifa investments</a> to stop exploration of coal in the area.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/miningzimbabwe/posts/never-tshuma-from-katambe-village-in-dinde-has-been-arrested-on-the-allegations-/2861701097380267/">Tshuma from Katambe Village in Dinde was arrested in April</a> on the allegations of inciting villagers to resist the exploration of coal by Chinese company Beifer Investments.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It has been reported that Beifer Investments has the support of the state to operate on that site, whereas the locals feel offended by such action hence them besieging the site where Beifer is set to operate on.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">According to CNRG founding Director Farai Maguwu, the Chinese are not only are harassing locals by exploring where locals are located, but they are destroying gravesites in Dinde.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Chinese have started drilling at Dinde, very close to the community graveside. Why desecrate the final resting place of our dearly departed ones, all in search of ill-gotten wealth. This criminality must stop,&#8221; said Maguwu.</p><p>The post <a href="https://miningzimbabwe.com/dinde-leader-arrested-for-inciting-violence-in-court-today/">Dinde leader arrested for inciting violence in court today</a> first appeared on <a href="https://miningzimbabwe.com">Mining Zimbabwe</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p2"><span class="s2">The stone, found on June 1, was shown to President Mokgweetsi Masisi in the capital Gaborone.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“It is believed to be the third largest gem-quality find in the world,” said Debswana’s managing director, Lynette Armstrong.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">The “rare and extraordinary stone … means so much in the context of diamonds and Botswana,” she said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“It brings hope to a nation that is struggling.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">It is also the biggest stone of gem quality to be discovered in the history of the company, a joint venture between the government and the global diamond giant De Beers.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Kuvimba Mining House’s gold mining asset, Freda Rebecca Mine, has broken a 20-year production record after it churned out 300kg of the yellow metal in May this year alone, it has been learnt.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">This is the second time in the history of the firm that such a milestone has been scored as Government ramps up efforts to achieve a US$12 billion mining economy by 2023.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The achievement means Kuvimba, where Government has majority holding, has managed to double the output at Freda Rebecca within a space of a year, making the mine the biggest in the country in terms of gold production.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">When the mining giant took over last year, Freda Rebecca was producing 150 kgs of gold per month and officials say they are targeting to produce more than 300kgs per month in the next three years.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Freda Rebecca Mine general manager, Mr Eliakem Hove, attributed the stellar performance to massive re-investment done by Kuvimba at the mine.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“We had a good performance where we recorded around 300kg against a plan of 244kg in one month,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Compared to last year after taking over, we were averaging 226kg per month. The success story is a combination of factors. Basically the key issue is re-investment in the business by our shareholder, which enabled us to recapitalise as well as have sufficient working capital. Combined with that is also team work from the employees, management and supervision. It’s a team effort that resulted in the numbers.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mr. Hove said the next five years should see Freda Rebecca producing 300kg every month.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kuvimba Mining House chief operating officer, Mr Cobus Bronn, weighed in: “KHM recognises and understands the importance of providing the required sustaining capital to the mine to ensure sustainable and improved production at the lowest possible operating costs. Freda Rebecca Gold Mine has a remaining life of mine of approximately five years and the company is actively looking to augment the current life of mine by evaluating near resources and secondly undertaking an extensive exploration plan to find and build the next mega mine to replace Freda Rebecca Mine.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Apart from Freda Rebecca, Kuvimba has two other gold mining assets — Shamva, and Jena Gold Mine — which are on target to produce 400kg and 75kg by December 2022 per month respectively.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Currently, Shamva is producing 40 000 tonnes of gold ore per month while Jena’s output stands at 28kg of gold.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kuvimba also has a stake in the Darwendale Platinum Project (Great Dyke Investments), Trojan Nickel Mine (Bindura Nickel Corporation), as well as in Zim Alloys Limited.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">As part of its expansion drive, Kuvimba has been investing heavily in key machinery and assets at its mines.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">At BNC, Kuvimba has finished the shaft deepening process, which allows the firm to extend mine life by seven years.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zim Alloys is now out of judicial management with all creditors having been paid and production is expected to start before September.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“The company has made significant progress and commodity pricing has been overall positive. The company will continue to require significant capital to achieve its growth strategy,” said Mr Bronn.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Sources said Kuvimba will be declaring a dividend before the end of this month after posting positive results during the last financial year, which ended on March 31.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Its current turnover is about US$25 million a month being boosted by international gold prices and nickel prices, a development which has seen the company contributing more than US$10 million to the Reserve Bank’s foreign <a href="https://miningzimbabwe.com/">c</a>urrency auction system.</span></p>

<p data-wtg-lazy="7">Said Chitove; “On 15 June at around 0630 hours, residents of Ruvimbo Phase 2 discovered a man who was having difficulty in breathing in an unfinished house at Stand Number 9378 Ruvimbo Phase 2.</p>
<p data-wtg-lazy="9">“An informant contacted Chemagamba police and together with CID (Criminal Investigations Department) officers attended the scene and found the man already dead.”</p>
<p>The now deceased had three deep wounds on the head and bruises all over his body.</p>
<p data-wtg-lazy="10">Police then carried out preliminary investigations in the area, which established that at around 3 am the same morning, four men, including the arrested pair of Mashove and Matoro, who all reside at 8526 Ruvimbo Phase 1, were seen bashing the now deceased.</p>
<p data-wtg-lazy="11">The motive of the murder remains unclear with some sources claiming Fundo was killed by his colleagues in a row over proceeds from illegal gold mining activities.</p>
<p data-wtg-lazy="12">A manhunt has since been launched to account for the other two murder suspects whose identities were not released.</p>
<p data-wtg-lazy="13">Police appealed to the public to observe the sanctity of life and desist from meting out instant justice on suspected criminals, but to hand them over to law enforcement agents for the law to take its course.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chinese investment in Africa has helped spark economic growth and improve social outcomes across the continent. Yet Chinese projects often seem to go hand-in-hand with civil protests. We wanted to find out whether these were isolated incidents or signalled broader discontent among the population.</p>
<p>In new research, we show that regions hosting Chinese-led projects are more likely to experience protests.</p>
<p>China’s financial involvement on the continent has grown dramatically since the launch of the forum on China-Africa co-operation (Focac) in 2000 and the China-Africa development fund in 2006. Today, China is Africa’s largest trading partner. China also spent an estimated US$350 billion (£250 million) on development programmes on the continent between 2000 and 2014 (the most recent data), on a par with what the US spent in the same period.</p>
<p>The social, economic and political implications of this vast investment are subject to much controversy. Western countries are critical of China’s attempt to gain “soft power” (gaining economic and cultural power without coercion) on the continent, saying it might undermine good governance and human rights. But what do African citizens think about China’s impact on their lives?</p>
<p>Don’t let yourself be misled. Understand issues with help from experts.</p>
<p>It is easy to find evidence of protests against Chinese projects and investments.</p>
<p>In the Kenyan archipelago of Lamu, for instance, residents and local businesses recently managed to block a proposed Chinese coal power plant, which they said would hurt the local tourism industry.</p>
<p>People in the Gambia have protested against Chinese fish factories, which have drained waste into nearby wildlife reserves, hurting the local fish industry and the environment.</p>
<p>In 2012, Zambian workers protested against low pay and hazardous working conditions at Chinese-run mines and even killed a Chinese manager.</p>
<p>Of course, these are just a few examples from across a huge continent — we wanted to explore whether there is a systematic link between Chinese projects and civil protests.</p>
<p>To do this, we used a global database on local protests that located around 125 000 protests across Africa and combined it with data on the location of Chinese projects across the continent.</p>
<p>We did find out that areas with more Chinese projects were more likely to experience protests.</p>
<p>We also found that the type of project and its location matter. For instance, energy projects, often hydropower, are generally far away from towns and cities.</p>
<p>By contrast, big infrastructural projects could be more likely to promote public demonstrations because they have visible effects on local and regional activities.</p>
<p><strong>Perceptions, influence and trust in governments</strong></p>
<p>There are a couple of potential explanations for this link between projects and protests.</p>
<p>First, we know from previous research that, compared with World Bank aid, Chinese finance is prone to being used by local elites to pursue their own interests and obtain many of the benefits, perhaps because of a lack of transparency in loan conditions, or because of China’s principle of not interfering in domestic affairs when granting loans, which gives local political leaders more power to allocate resources to projects.</p>
<p>All this can lower citizens’ trust in government institutions.</p>
<p>When people lose trust in institutions, they may prefer protesting to voting.</p>
<p>Our analysis confirms that areas with a larger number of Chinese projects do see lowered <a href="https://miningzimbabwe.com/">t</a>rust in local government.</p>
<p>Second, using data from the Afrobarometer, which surveys Africans on their view on democracy, governance and other issues, we observe a growing sense of China’s rising domestic economic influence among citizens who are more strongly exposed to Chinese projects.</p>
<p>This perception can stir protests when citizens feel that the economic changes are serving Chinese rather than domestic interests.</p>
<p>But under what circumstances will citizens’ grievances and distrust effectively result in protests?</p>
<p>Almost unsurprisingly, and reminiscent of the Arab spring, we find that improved mobile connectivity may have played an important role in helping citizens to co-ordinate.</p>
<p>Protests are an interesting way to explore how African citizens are responding to Chinese investment.</p>
<p>A direct and legitimate form of political participation, protests, can draw attention to grievances and demand accountability from governments.</p>
<p>Our study shows a systematic link between Chinese projects and the occurrence of protests.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A proudly Zimbabwean machine engineering, steel fabrication, mining, farming, and lifting equipment company, Yagden Engineering has called on the government to support local mining equipment manufacturers and suppliers as this will reduce externalisation of funds as well as smuggling and the creation of employment.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/RudairoDickson">Rudairo Mapuranga</a></p>
<p>Speaking to Mining Zimbabwe at a site visit by Mines and Mining Development Portfolio Committee Chairperson Hon Edmond Mkaratigwa on a fact-finding mission on challenges local equipment suppliers are facing, Yagden Director, Mr Wayne “Mukwasha” Williams said the government should protect mining equipment suppliers, as well as miners from cheap and substandard and reject equipment which is dumped on the country.</p>
<p>“There are equipment suppliers who have flooded the market with cheap and substandard mining equipment thereby prejudicing miners of the real value to their investment.</p>
<p>“Many small-scale and artisanal miners in the country are buying this cheap equipment which becomes absolute three months down the line,” Wayne said.</p>
<p>According to Kudakwashe Mbondiya (2016) sited by Torque Mude (2016), the Changfa generators and mining compressors (Chinese products) are not reliable because they are not strong and always need to be rested at regular intervals when using them.</p>
<p>He also expressed disdain for Changfa generator which he says requires a lot of water for cooling when started.</p>
<p>Due to this, Wayne called for the government to address the uncertainty caused by substandard equipment in the sector which he said delays work and promotes smuggling of minerals.</p>
<p>The Yagden Director also said that some equipment suppliers are in the habit of lending artisanal miners cheap equipment as a way of getting all the minerals produced by the miners at a very low price.</p>
<p>“All equipment should have serial numbers which are traceable by the government.</p>
<p>“The government should be able to track all the mining equipment in the country so that they know where mining activities are taking place and where the gold is being sold.” He said.</p>
<p>Positive in buying local Buying local keeps money circulating within the local economy. Studies have shown that local businesses recirculate a greater share of every dollar as they create locally owned supply chains and invest in their employees.</p>
<p>Local retailers are believed to return 72 per cent of their revenue into the local economy, compared to just 14 per cent for national chain retailers. Money circulating through the local economy benefits everyone who is a part of each transaction. This, therefore, means that if mining firms buy equipment from local manufacturers, money circulating within the economy will be able to sustain many people.</p>
<p>According to Norton Miners Association Chairperson, Mr Privelage Moyo, the country, because it was not promoting local businesses, transactions happening are benefiting other nations leaving us in abject poverty.</p>
<p>He said that miners in Zimbabwe are working for other countries as what they are digging underground is benefiting the east and western countries because the miners are investing a lot in their equipment“As a country let alone as the mining sector, we are putting all our effort and power in the labour but at the end, our output is benefiting other countries like China. Our minerals go towards their country’s industries to which they dictate the buying price and in turn, they manufacture equipment whose price they peg and engage their Chinese people supported by their banks to come back again to our African countries to trade again the very machines and accessories from our minerals and scoop the revolving foreign currency back to their nations.</p>
<p>“As a country due to ignorance of ministries, we are only surviving on peanuts and crumbs that’s why we cannot afford a budget surplus of foreign currency. We have industries which are ghost houses as there is no support and ministries are not sharing ideas on what&#8217;s required so that citizens may take up those tasks.</p>
<p>“Everything world over is advanced from someone’s design by its automobile industry.</p>
<p>In our mining sector equipment and consumable are being imported and being sold by the very manufacturers at our huge expense.</p>
<p>Most of the equipment you will realise that it consumes a big chunk of our earnings through imports yet all the raw materials are available locally and let alone profits from their trade find their way back to their mother countries.</p>
<p>If as a starting point we cut the Chinese in the trade we save a bit for our country’s earnings.” he said.</p>
<p>As long as the government prioritises foreigners first before citizens, it spells doom for our country, citizens are first and should be considered first in all, then complimentary support should come from the country’s friends being “the foreigners”.</p>
<p>Relying on foreign equipment even in the small-scale sector breathes dependence and mediocrity upon the country and it kills innovation.</p>
<p><strong>What miners think the government should do</strong></p>
<p>Moyo said it was of greater importance for Ministries to start working together to curb the prejudice brought by shameless businesses from other countries who are dumping their cheap equipment on the country.</p>
<p>“This is why we were calling up Ministries to join hands and start working together. They are some advantages of Ministries being independent but, on the ground, regarding production and development, they are outweighed by disadvantages.</p>
<p>“As miners, we feel our line Ministry is being sidelined by other ministries that are allowing and authorising Chinese and other foreign nationals who are manufacturing substandard mining equipment and machinery in their countries to be retailers in our country at the expense of our local business people.” he said.</p>
<p>According to Moyo, Ministries should promote homegrown ideas and products. Hammer Mills and many other products used in the small scale and artisanal mining sector should be produced locally as a way of promoting all small businesses in the country to grow.</p>
<p>“All that the Ministries can do is to expose its staff or institutions to developed countries and learn production modules which adds value to our country.</p>
<p>“We have many informal engineers in Mbare who are trying very hard to come up with the mining industry equipment, machinery and consumable requirements but not even one ministry cares about their growth although they are somehow producing usable equipment from scrap metal and proving to be useful and much better than that of the Chinese,” Moyo said.</p>
<p><strong>What needs to be done?</strong></p>
<p>The first thing the government should do is to convince and make Zimbabweans understand the merits of what is currently produced locally while ensuring citizens that which is produced locally is sustainably produced as per the trending market demands.</p>
<p>The government does not necessarily need to target and discourage foreign-owned companies but should prove to miners that the equipment produced in the country can satisfy the market in all its respects.</p>
<p>The Mines and Mining Development Portfolio Committee and the Ministry of mines should have adequate data and a market-driven plan for establishing startup packages for our small scale and artisanal miners.</p>
<p>The move is achievable through convincing data and optimum business models that can be tested in the country.</p>
<p>The advantage of local manufacturers is that they can be linked up with local financiers without challenges and they can easily give other associated services like empowering training to upcoming businesses as part of the package.</p>
<p><strong>What is the government doing?</strong></p>
<p>According to the Chairperson of the Parliamentary Portfolio on Mines and Mining Development Hon Edmund Mkaratigwa, the government will soon roll out a program that will support equipment suppliers by encouraging miners to buy local.</p>
<p>Mkaratigwa said the government through the Mines Portfolio committee was going to create a pilot project to support its ideas.</p>
<p>“The main plan is to have local suppliers prove themselves to be innovative and complementary to the mainstream government plans and targets and our support is always there.</p>
<p>“YAGDEN for example possesses vast experience and knowledge derived from already tried ideas in the field and that can be brought to the fore for trial in sampled areas for a start at a national level. They need that opportunity because their work is huge and potential can be harnessed for the broader good of their business and the Zimbabwe vision at large.” Hon Mkratigwa said.</p>
<p><strong>What equipment suppliers should do?</strong></p>
<p>According to Mkaratigwa some equipment suppliers should move from being backyard small equipment suppliers to renowned equipment manufacturers and should also be innovative enough to explore the corridors that are being exploited by the Chinese to put a balance in the industry.</p>
<p>“On the other hand, equipment suppliers should consider those who are just starting up, a gap that is currently being exploited by foreign manufacturers. That will enable companies to grow quickly and build up capacities for supplying to large mining firms.</p>
<p>The issue is about building brands and maintaining standards as well as being ambitious.</p>
<p>“They need support but they should find entry-level onto the broader mining market by being innovative and being prepared to cooperate where possible.</p>
<p>The industry needs to come together to discuss and start to build their relevance in the sector. Moving from being backyard small scale manufacturers to renowned names.” He said.</p>
<p>The Mines Portfolio chair also said that the committee stands to support equipment manufacturers because the US$ 12 BILLION mark is achievable through reliable machinery and equipment in line with the adage “the workman is as good as his tools.”</p>
<p><strong>How to curb leakages caused by foreign suppliers?</strong></p>
<p>According to Hon Mkaratigwa, to limit leakages caused by foreign suppliers who lease mining equipment and consumable to artisanal miners to exploit them and loot the resources is by promoting local suppliers of such equipment and encourage artisanal miners to engage them.</p>
<p>“The main way to limit such leakages is promoting local suppliers of such equipment and the whole matter can start from there.” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://miningzimbabwe.com/tag/prospect-resources/">Arcadia lithium</a> pilot plant crushing circuit in Goromonzi is now operational with production expected to begin within the coming week <a href="https://www.prospectresources.com.au/">Prospect Resources</a> announced on Tuesday.</p>
<p><em>Anerudo Mapuranga</em></p>
<p>The Australia Stock Exchange-listed mining concern took delivery of the pre-assembled pilot plant crushing equipment last month indicating a major milestone for the Arcadia project.</p>
<p>“A big milestone for the #Arcadia #pilotplant. The crushing circuit is operational, with production to start within the next week!” the company said.</p>
<p>The company Managing Director Sam Hosack commending on the development on Twitter said:</p>
<p>“Commissioning is always the most challenging and rewarding part of a project, tackling arising issues and having the commitment to deliver on your goals. Safely and confidently let’s get that technical petalite product stockpile built.”</p>
<p>The operation of the pilot plant will allow for the accumulation of knowledge during design, mitigating the scaling issues that peer lithium producers have experienced on account of a too-rapid growth in supply</p>
<p>Prospect will first focus on producing petalite, which is technical grade and spodumene, (chemical) grade lithium samples.</p>
<p>In mid-April Mr Hosack said the project remained on time and on budget with a target to ship high purity petalite by the end of June 2021.</p>
<p>“The pilot plan forms a critical part of our project development and market integration strategies and we look forward to providing key customers with high-value petalite product to complete their qualification requirements.</p>
<p>“Prospect is generating spodumene samples via an experienced third party laboratory, as downstream lithium chemical customers only require 2kg spodumene samples to qualify,” Mr Hosack said.</p>
<p>Arcadia represents a globally significant hard rock lithium resource and is being rapidly developed by Prospect’s team, focusing on near term production of high purity petalite and spodumene concentrates.</p>
<p>Arcadia is one of the most advanced lithium projects globally, with a definitive feasibility study, offtake partners secured and a clear pathway to production.</p><p>The post <a href="https://miningzimbabwe.com/arcadia-crushing-circuit-now-operational-production-next-week/">Arcadia crushing circuit now operational, production next week</a> first appeared on <a href="https://miningzimbabwe.com">Mining Zimbabwe</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>
