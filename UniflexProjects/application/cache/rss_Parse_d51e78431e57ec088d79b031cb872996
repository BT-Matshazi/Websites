					<description><![CDATA[Proven and probable reserves across Eagle and Olive total 155 million tonnes grading 0.65 g/t gold for a total of 3.3 million oz.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>After declaring commercial production at the Eagle mine in Canada&#8217;s Yukon Territory earlier this month, Victoria Gold has provided production guidance for the second half of this year – it expects to generate 85,000 oz. to 100,000 oz. of gold in the last two quarters at all-in sustaining costs of $950 to $1,100 per oz.</p>



<p>“Achieving commercial production was a great accomplishment for the entire Victoria team of employees and contractors,” John McConnell, the company’s president and CEO, said in a release. </p>



<p>“Going forward, the team will now focus on optimizing the operation and driving down all-in sustaining costs.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"><blockquote><p>Proven and probable reserves across Eagle and Olive total 155 million tonnes grading 0.65 g/t gold for a total of 3.3 million oz</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>According to the company, Victoria’s latest guidance accounts for the uncertainties due to the covid-19 pandemic and incorporates the final ramp up of the operation from the start of commercial production through to full capacity.</p>



<p>The company anticipates that its next two sets of quarterly results will reflect this ramp-up, with the third quarter expected to reflect the higher end of the cost guidance with decreases by the fourth quarter and into 2021.</p>



<p>The Eagle mine reached the&nbsp;commercial production milestone&nbsp;on Jul. 1.</p>



<p>In June, the open pit operation generated 13,828 gold oz., bringing its production total for the first half of the year to 38,896 oz.</p>



<p>Victoria wholly owns the 555-sq.-km Dublin Gulch property in central Yukon, 375 km north of Whitehorse, which hosts the Eagle and Olive gold deposits.</p>



<p>Proven and probable reserves across Eagle and Olive total 155 million tonnes grading 0.65 g/t gold for a total of 3.3 million oz. Cut-off grades for the reserves vary with deposit and material type and range from 0.15 g/t gold to 0.58 g/t gold.</p>



<p>Based on a technical report released last December, the Eagle mine is expected to produce an average of over 210,000 oz. of gold a year at all-in sustaining costs of $774 per oz. over a mine life in excess of 10 years.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The World Economic Forum estimates that 395 million new jobs could be created by 2030 if businesses prioritize nature.

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Putting nature above business considerations has the potential to generate 395 million jobs and $10.1 trillion in business opportunities by 2030, the <a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_The_Future_Of_Nature_And_Business_2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest report</a> by World Economic Forum (WEF) suggests.</p>



<p>Unprecedented <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2020/06/24/WEOUpdateJune2020" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">job losses and economic uncertainty</a> following the outbreak of covid-19 have governments looking into ways to stimulate growth in a safe manner. According to the WEF experts, the answer can be found in what they call a “nature first” approach.</p>



<p>“The global economy is inextricably linked to the health of our planet,” the report says. “How we produce, manufacture, consume and ultimately manage our waste is straining nature’s ability to cope.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"><blockquote><p>The new approach to mining and energy generation could create 87 million jobs in 10 years</p><cite>The World Economic Forum</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>When it comes to mining and power generation, the authors said that nature-positive business &nbsp;—those that add value to nature — could generate an estimated $3.5 trillion worth of annual value and create 87 million jobs by 2030.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Accounting for an estimated 23% of global GDP and 16% of employment, the extraction, production, manufacturing and generation of energy and materials is both a major contributor to global economic growth and a major threat to biodiversity,” the report reads.</p>



<p>The WEF adds that the sector’s negative effects – air pollution and carbon emissions – account for $9 trillion annually, or around 10.5% of global GDP.</p>



<p>Reversing the costly impact, the report asserts, involves improving consumption efficiency to reduce the amount of resources that need to be extracted. It also involves improving how those resources are extracted to minimize their impact on ecosystems while shifting to more renewable energy.</p>



<p>“Supportive regulations – such as those that encourage and support environmentally sound extractives project design, systematic rehabilitation of mining sites, and waste collection and reuse – will be significant in unlocking the value of nature-positive businesses.”</p>



<h2><strong>Circular economy</strong></h2>



<p>The study is built on real world examples, where business outcomes have been enhanced by nature-positive outcomes.&nbsp;British multinational automaker Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) collected and reused around 300,000 tonnes of aluminum between 2013 and 2019. </p>



<p>It translated into a 30% recovery of the 180,000 tonnes of aluminium (JLR) used annually in the six-year period. The initiative has resulted in an overall drop of 46% of carbon emissions in JLR’s global vehicle production operations.</p>



<p>Elion, the first Chinese company to commit to 100% renewables in its operations by 2030, started as a salt chemical engineering business in the Kubuqi Desert of inner Mongolia. Frequent sandstorms damaged production and increased costs in its early years of operation. To combat desertification and sandstorms, Elion developed a comprehensive ecological restoration-based economic system.</p>



<p>The company has already restored nearly 650,000 hectares of desert land, thanks to the construction of sand-protecting barriers, afforestation and the closure of land for natural regeneration. This has allowed the formation of an ecological microclimate in the desert, which is attracting ecotourists and companies focused on growing medicinal plants.</p>

<p>“We can&nbsp;address&nbsp;the looming&nbsp;bio-diversity&nbsp;crisis and reset the economy&nbsp;in a way that creates and protects millions of jobs,”&nbsp;Akanksha Khatri, Head of the Nature Action Agenda at the WEF, said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The transition to a green economy is being fuelled by minerals, with demand for resources projected to double by 2060. It means that the mining sector will play a critical role in the massification of technologies such as wind turbines and solar panels.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Improving resource recovery in extraction can save up to $225 billion by 2030, the report says. “Mining and oil and gas operations often do not fully utilize all the resources in one site before moving on to new areas, increasing damage to biodiversity. New technologies and more mechanization could enhance material recovery rates by up to 50%.”</p>



<p>Investing in environmental, social and governance (ESG) is currently estimated at over $20 trillion in assets under management, according to Deloitte’s estimates. Companies that fail to deliver value beyond compliance could face financial consequences and a blow to their reputations.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Drilling returned 10.3 metres of 52.1 g/t gold and 4.3 metres of 21.01 g/t gold up to 150 metres east of existing mineral reserves.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Alamos Gold&nbsp;has released exploration results from its Island Gold mine in Ontario, which extend high grade areas at the Island East and Main zones, as well as at Island West.</p>



<p>The majority of the notable intercepts in the latest release are from the E1E zone and confirm the vertical continuity of this area over up to 1.2 km, between depths of 300 metres and 1,500 metres.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"><blockquote><p>Drilling at Island Main returned 10.3 metres of 52.1 g/t gold and 4.3 metres of 21.01 g/t gold up to 150 metres east of existing mineral reserves</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Drill highlights from Island East Lower include 2.3 metres of 44.3 g/t gold and 4.9 metres of 29.05 g/t gold – Alamos continues to hit gold mineralization at E1E within a 120-metre-long gap between inferred resource portions, suggesting a 1.2-km vertical span of this zone in the eastern portion of the deposit.</p>



<p>At Island East Upper, notable new intercepts from E1E include 3.6 metres of 18.72 g/t gold and 2.2 metres of 21.3 g/t gold: these high-grade intervals are from an area that is 200 metres east of existing reserves.</p>



<p>Drilling at Island Main returned 10.3 metres of 52.1 g/t gold and 4.3 metres of 21.01 g/t gold up to 150 metres east of existing mineral reserves.</p>



<p>In addition, surface drilling at Island West returned 5.6 metres of 25.41 g/t gold from the C-zone, extending the gold mineralization by 70 metres from previous drilling.</p>



<p>Additional holes targeting potential new parallel zones returned 2.8 metres of 40.34 g/t gold and 8.6 metres of 3.9 g/t gold.</p>



<p>“Island Gold has seen exceptional growth over the last several years with the deposit doubling in size since we acquired it in 2017,” John McCluskey, the company’s president and CEO, said in a release. </p>



<p>“This growth has been incorporated into a Phase III Expansion study of the operation, which we will be releasing the details of later this week.”</p>



<p>McCluskey added that these latest high-grade exploration results suggest both significant potential for reserve and resource growth at the site as well as upside to the Phase III Expansion scenario.</p>



<p>Four underground and three surface rigs are currently working at Island Gold, with a focus on near-mine resource definition.</p>



<p>Last year, Island Gold generated 150,400 gold oz. at mine-site all-in sustaining costs of $656 per oz. Proven and probable reserves for the site total 3.6 million tonnes at 10.37 g/t gold, containing 1.2 million gold oz. Cut-off grades are between 2.82 g/t gold and 4.89 g/t gold.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Indicated resources at Klaza stand at 4.5 million tonnes grading 4.8 g/t gold, 98 g/t silver, 0.7% lead and 0.9% zinc, containing a total of 907,000 gold-equivalent oz.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>An updated preliminary economic assessment (PEA) for&nbsp;Rockhaven Resources’&nbsp;wholly owned Klaza project in the Dawson Range gold belt in Canada&#8217;s Yukon Territory outlines a 12-year, combined open-pit and underground operation producing gold and silver doré as well as lead and zinc concentrates.</p>



<p>With total payable metals production of 750,000 oz. of gold and 13.8 million oz. of silver over 12 years at all-in sustaining costs of $875 per gold-equivalent oz., the after-tax net present value for the project comes in at C$378 million, at a 5% discount rate.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"><blockquote><p>Indicated resources at Klaza stand at 4.5 million tonnes grading 4.8 g/t gold, 98 g/t silver, 0.7% lead and 0.9% zinc, containing a total of 907,000 gold-equivalent oz</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Based on an average plant throughput of 1,900 t/d, open pit mining at the site would start in the first year of operations for a three-year period whereas the underground portion would operate over the 12-year life of the combined mine. The initial capital cost figure stands at C$244 million.</p>



<p>“This study demonstrates that Rockhaven’s Klaza deposit could support a mine with a long life and robust economics,” Matt Turner, the company’s president and CEO, said in a release. </p>



<p>“Since the last economic study was completed in 2016, closer spaced drilling has better defined the upper portions of the deposit, resulting in higher average grades in a superior resource category.”</p>



<p>Turner added that based on the results of this PEA, Rockhaven is now looking to advance Klaza towards a pre-feasibility level alongside continued drilling targeting new discoveries.</p>



<p>The proposed processing flowsheet includes crushing, grinding and milling of the mineralized material, followed by a conventional flotation process to generate lead, zinc and arsenopyrite concentrates. </p>



<p>The arsenopyrite concentrate would be treated with an on-site, 250 t/d pressure oxidation (Pox) circuit. Precious metals would also be leached from the zinc and lead concentrates.</p>



<p>In the release, Rockhaven highlights the exploration upside at Klaza – the PEA evaluates the mining of three (out of eleven) known zones of mineralization.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"><blockquote><p>PEA evaluates the mining of three (out of eleven) known zones of mineralization</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Indicated resources at Klaza stand at 4.5 million tonnes grading 4.8 g/t gold, 98 g/t silver, 0.7% lead and 0.9% zinc, containing a total of 907,000 gold-equivalent oz. Additional inferred resources total 5.7 million tonnes at 2.8 g/t gold, 76 g/t silver, 0.6% lead and 0.7% zinc, for a further 725,000 oz. of gold-equivalent. The pit-constrained portion is based on a 1 g/t gold-equivalent cut-off whereas the underground component is derived using a 2.3 g/t gold gold-equivalent cut-off.</p>



<p>The 11 known zones of mineralization at the road-accessible Klaza property cover a combined strike length of over 10 km. These are within a 1.8-km wide corridor where low to intermediate sulphidation veins feature gold, silver, zinc and lead mineralization.</p>



<p>Rockhaven’s stock was trading down 10.5% at Tuesday&#8217;s close on the TSXV. The company has a C$31.8 million market capitalization.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Caldas Gold (TSXV: CGC) is raising aggregate gross proceeds of C$45 million (about $33m) after <a href="https://www.caldasgold.ca/news-and-investors/press-releases/press-releases-details/2020/Caldas-Gold-Announces-CA45-Million-Bought-Deal-Private-Placement-of-Special-Warrants/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coming into agreement</a> with a syndicate of underwriters led by Scotiabank and Canaccord Genuity to purchase, on a bought deal private placement basis, 20 million special warrants of the company at a price of C$2.25 each.</p>



<p>The issue price represents an approximate 16.6% discount to Caldas Gold&#8217;s share price of C$2.70 at Friday&#8217;s market close.</p>



<p>Each special warrant entitles the holder to receive one unit of Caldas Gold, with each unit comprising one Caldas Gold common share and one common share purchase warrant. The common share purchase warrants are exercisable for five years following the closing date at a price of C$2.75 per common share.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"><blockquote><p>This offering is another step in securing the financing required for the expansion of Caldas Gold’s mining operations at the new Deeps Zone operation</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Caldas Gold has also granted the underwriters an option, exercisable at any time up to 48 hours prior to the closing date, to purchase up to an additional 2.22 million special warrants at the issue price for additional proceeds of C$5 million.</p>



<p>This offering is another step in securing the financing required for the expansion of Caldas Gold’s mining operations at the new Deeps Zone operation of Marmato project in Colombia, chairman and CEO Serafino Iacono says.</p>



<p>Iacono adds that marketing of the <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/04/15/2016880/0/en/Gran-Colombia-Announces-Details-for-the-Forthcoming-Quarterly-Repayment-of-Its-Gold-Notes-on-April-30-2020.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously announced</a> gold-linked notes by Gran Colombia Gold (TSX: GCM), which owns 74% of the company, is continuing with positive feedback to date and expects to finalize terms shortly, with an announcement on the expected closing to follow soon thereafter.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Wheaton Precious Metals (NYSE: WPM) has indicated to Caldas Gold that it plans to subscribe for up to C$5 million pursuant to the special warrants offering. The companies <a href="https://www.mining.com/caldas-gold-wheaton-reach-110-million-marmato-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently signed a non-binding term sheet</a> for a precious metals streaming arrangement on the Marmato mine, which has been in operation since 1991.</p>



<p>Located within a historical mining district, the Marmato project contains approximately two million ounces of gold in the measured and indicated resource categories and 3.3 million ounces in the Inferred category.</p>



<p>A prefeasibility study (PFS) is currently in progress and expected to be completed mid-year, focusing on the development of the Deeps Zone mineralization, construction of a new 4,000 tpd plant and new dry stack tailings storage facilities. Mechanized mining is expected to begin in 2023 with an additional estimated 1.6 million ounces of gold recovered over a 16-year mine life.</p>



<p>Shares of Caldas Gold plunged 13.2% midday Tuesday on the latest financing announcement. The Vancouver-based gold miner has a market capitalization of approximately C$118.6 million.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Results confirm that project in the Yukon is one of the largest copper-gold deposits in the world. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In its first estimate since 2010,&nbsp;Western Copper and Gold&nbsp;(TSX: WRN; NYSE-AM: WRN) has updated the resource for its 100%-owned <a href="https://www.mining.com/lng-costs-are-impressive-for-western-copper-and-gold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Casino project in the Yukon</a> with more drill results, confirming that it is one of the largest copper-gold deposits in the world.</p>



<p>The new resource includes results from the 2019 drill program and drilling performed from 2010 through 2012 that was unavailable when the company put together its 2010 model; it also incorporates an updated geologic model. The resource remains open at depth.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"><blockquote><p>The estimated C$2.45 billion capex for Casino is “comparable to emerging greenfield and brownfield projects”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Casino now has total measured and indicated resources of 2.4 billion tonnes grading 0.14% copper, 0.19 gram gold per tonne, 1.5 grams silver per tonne for 7.6 billion lb. copper, 14.5 million oz. gold and 113.5 million oz. silver. Inferred resources add 1.46 billion tonnes grading 0.10% copper, 0.14 gram gold, 1.2 grams silver for 3.26 billion lb. copper, 6.6 million oz. gold and 55.2 million oz. silver.</p>



<p>In addition, while the heap leach operation won’t recover moly so it isn’t included in the total resource numbers, it will be recovered in the milling operation at a grade of 0.017% moly in the M&amp;I category and 0.010% in the inferred.</p>



<p>CEO Paul West-Sells said the new resource numbers will be incorporated into an updated feasibility study but did not specify a date. He also noted that the company expects that, “in addition to the significantly higher number of tonnes, that the strip ratio should decrease significantly due to the conversion of inferred material to measured and indicated in the pit.”</p>



<p>In a July investor presentation, Western Copper and Gold noted that the estimated C$2.45 billion capex for Casino is “comparable to emerging greenfield and brownfield projects.”</p>



<p>Shareholders in the company include management and the board (12%); private high-net worth individuals (48%); and institutional investors (10%).</p>



<p>Over the last year the company has traded in a range of 44¢ and C$1.90 per share and at presstime in Toronto was trading at C$1.57 per share, up 3.1%. The company has about 115 million common shares outstanding for a C$180 million market cap.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Chinese iron ore imports hit 33-month high in June, on pace for record year.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Iron ore prices were hitting one-year highs on Tuesday as the economic recovery in China, where more than half the world&#8217;s steel is forged, surpasses even the most bullish expectations.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"><blockquote><p>&#8220;We see potential for China to have been 60-70% of global metals demand in June – never before have we seen one country so dominant&#8221;</p><cite>BMO Capital Markets</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>According to Fastmarkets MB, benchmark 62% Fe fines imported into Northern China were changing hands for $112.48 a tonne on Tuesday, up 22% since the start of the year. </p>



<p>China&#8217;s iron ore imports jumped 17% in June from the May total to hit the highest level since October 2017, according to customs data released overnight. </p>



<p>Cargoes of the steelmaking ingredient totalled 101.7m tonnes last month compared to just over 87m tonnes in May, and up 35% from June 2019.&nbsp;For the first six months of 2020 shipments reached 547m tonnes, up 9.6% compared to 2019.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the current pace, 2020 full year total would handily beat last year&#8217;s 1.069 billion tonnes, which was just below 2017&#8217;s record 1.075 billion tonnes.</p>



<p>In a note, BMO Capital Markets estimates that China accounted for over 75% of global seaborne iron ore imports during the second quarter of this year.</p>

<p>BMO said when coupled with resilient domestic production of commodities, the robust import numbers &#8220;point to extremely strong Chinese apparent demand figures in June&#8221;: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Given ex-China weakness, we see potential for China to have been 60-70% of global metals demand in June – never before have we seen one country so dominant, though with ex-China recovery we expect this trend to reverse in Q3.</p></blockquote>

					<description><![CDATA[Construction and engineering works are progressing to plan at the copper-gold project in Brazil, with start-up expected in H2 2021.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Mineração Vale Verde and Appian Capital Advisory <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://appiancapitaladvisory.com/mvv-operational-update/" target="_blank">announced</a> on Tuesday the first blast at the Serrote copper-gold project in Alagoas, Brazil.</p>



<p>According to Appian, the pre-stripping program has now handled over one million tonnes of material. Construction and engineering works are progressing to plan, with start-up expected in H2 2021.</p>



<p>Based on definitive feasibility study (“DFS”), Serrote will require <a href="https://www.mining.com/appian-appoints-former-anglo-exec-to-lead-brazil-operations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$250 million in capital</a> for a conventional, low-strip open-pit operation targeted to produce 20,000 tonnes of copper equivalent per year over 14 years.</p>



<p>&#8220;Serrote continues to demonstrate robust economics with potential upside, and we are seeing strong interest from offtake and financing partners,&#8221;  said Paulo Castellari, CEO, Vale Verde &amp; Appian Brazil.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company says it would use the proceeds to fund restarting and ramping up production from its Pumpkin Hollow underground mine in Nevada. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Nevada Copper (TSX: NCU) plans to raise, through a bought deal offering of 643.7 million units of the company at C$0.15 per unit, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/07/13/2061462/0/en/Nevada-Copper-Announces-97-Million-Bought-Deal-Public-Offering-And-Proposed-Retirement-of-Convertible-Debt.html" target="_blank">approximately C$97 million</a> (about $71 million) to address the company’s “serious financial difficulty.”</p>



<p>The US-focused copper miner has entered into an agreement with Scotiabank, which on behalf of a syndicate of underwriters including RBC Capital Markets and National Bank Financial would purchase the units. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"><blockquote><p>Without the offering, the company says it would be in financial difficulty due to the lack of available cash and funding resources</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Each&nbsp;unit consists of one common share of Nevada Copper and one-half of a common share purchase warrant, with each full warrant entitling the holder to purchase one common share at C$0.20 per share for a period of 18 months following closing of the offering.</p>



<p>Nevada Copper has also granted the underwriters an over-allotment option, which could raise an additional C$3.6 million for the company.</p>



<p>The company says it would use the net proceeds to fund its operations, including restarting and ramping up production from its Pumpkin Hollow underground mine in Nevada, repaying a $30 million convertible loan from its largest shareholder Pala Investments, repaying other outstanding indebtedness including a further $9.6 million to Pala, and for general corporate purposes.</p>



<p>The $30 million convertible loan was part of a financial package agreed in March with Pala, which subsequently syndicated a portion of the loan, including a principal amount of $13.4 million, to an affiliate of Castlelake LP, Nevada Copper&#8217;s second-largest shareholder.</p>



<p>Pala and Castlelake have agreed to waive the applicable prepayment premiums and to subscribe for about 303 million units for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $45.4 million pursuant to the offering. In addition, they have also committed to subscribe for up to an additional 163 million units pursuant to the offering for gross proceeds of approximately C$24.5 million.</p>



<h3><strong>Financial hardship exemption</strong></h3>



<p>Nevada Copper also announced that the company intends to apply to the TSX for a “financial hardship” exemption from the requirements to obtain shareholder approval of the offering, on the basis that without the offering, it would be in financial difficulty due to the lack of available cash and funding resources. The offering is designed to improve the company’s financial situation, it said. </p>



<p>Nevada Copper had been aiming to restart its Pumpkin Hollow mine this quarter, where the ramp-up earlier this year was held back by government restrictions to control the covid-19 outbreak.</p>



<p>The company maintains that mill restart at the underground mine is still <a href="https://www.mining.com/nevada-copper-on-track-to-resume-production-in-q3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled for August</a>, subject to revision based on impacts of the covid-19 pandemic and other factors. The goal is to <a href="https://www.mining.com/nevada-copper-expects-full-scale-production-in-q4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ramp up to full production</a> capacity during the fourth quarter.</p>



<p>It expected, as a result of the above application, the TSX would extend the remedial delisting review that Nevada Copper is currently under for a period of 120 days.</p>



<p>Nevada Copper shares declined 18.9% by midday Tuesday to a near 52-week low. The Vancouver-based company has a market capitalization of C$122.9 million.</p>
