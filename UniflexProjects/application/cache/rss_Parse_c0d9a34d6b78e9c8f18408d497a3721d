<p>Information is key in the fight against COVID-19 which has prompted surface mining industry association, ASPASA to ensure that its members and their staff are well informed about the disease.</p>



<p>Since the beginning of the outbreak in South Africa, the association has launched an active communication campaign designed to convey news and finding about the disease. It hosted its first-ever webinar during lockdown and published an array of posters that can be downloaded, printed and displayed by its members.</p>



<p>These are updated regularly as new information becomes available in order to assist in the response to the disease as well as allay fears and counter misinformation in the workplace.</p>



<p>ASPASA director, Nico Pienaar, says that a lot of information available on social and other media platforms, but stakeholders do not always know how it relates to our industry and circumstances. Mining is quite different to office environments and even to other outdoor activities such as farming or other business trades.</p>



<p>“As a result, we try to put out information that is relevant to our industry and helps in the fight against disease. Our poster campaign and newsletter information is aimed at spreading infection control measures, social distancing steps, PPE applications and other importing information that can be shared widely among staff stakeholders. In some instance, if required, we also try to address misconceptions so that we can deal with facts alone,” said Pienaar.</p>



<p>The latest posters address some of the latest challenges highlighted by ASPASA members and include information on gauging risk levels when coming into contact with COVID-19 positive individuals, disease risk and quarantine criteria, natural immune system boosters, home remedies for healthy individuals and more. “We hope that these interventions will help our industry to effectively fight the disease and stop its spread in the near future,” concluded Pienaar.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Nevada Gold Mines (NGM) was established in 2019 and has posted an impressive performance in its first 12 months of operation delivering real value to all its stakeholders.</p>



<p>NGM is a joint venture operated by Barrick Gold and Newmont Corporation. In its first year of combined operation, NGM not only met the production and cost targets set out at the start of the joint venture, but did so despite the past few months of stress experienced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>According to chief executive and president Mark Bristow, this was a significant achievement, considering that the joint venture had required the integration of multiple assets, including three Tier One mines into a unified complex under a new leadership team. A Tier One Gold Asset is a mine with a stated life in excess of 10 years, annual production of at least 500 000 ounces of gold and total cash costs per ounce over the mine life that are in the lower half of the industry cost curve.</p>



<p>“The new team was drawn from both legacy companies. It started with a clean slate in a fit-for-purpose structure, integrating the two bodies of knowledge to produce new models and fresh opportunities, and introduced a strong geological focus to the operations. It was the strength of the team and the structure, incidentally, that enabled NGM to deal so quickly and effectively with the unprecedented threat posed by the pandemic,” Bristow said.</p>



<p>At the same time, the company has been working with the State of Nevada and its stakeholders to provide financial and logistical support to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on its employees, local communities and the State.</p>

</div><figcaption><em>Video credit: Barrick Gold </em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Bristow added that by removing the fences that had previously separated geologically connected assets, mines and projects that clearly belonged together could be combined into larger and more efficient operations, with substantial savings as an immediate benefit. “Even more important, this joint venture has created a platform from where we can see a bright new future for NGM as the leader of its industry in every respect: truly a case of the best assets and the best people delivering the best returns,” he concluded.</p>

<p>Exxaro is celebrating following Matla Coal Mine&#8217;s achievement of 730 lost-time injury (LTI) free days. This achievement is equivalent to two years of zero mineworker LTIs.</p>



<p>This accomplishment forms part of Exxaro’s Khetha Ukuphepha safety campaign, which was launched in 2019 across all business units to address the risky nature of mining work. The cornerstone of the company’s zero-harm pledge, the campaign ensures that every employee adheres to strict safety standards and procedures both at work and home.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Exxaro celebrated three years of fatality-free operations with a steady decrease in their lost-time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) over the last five years. In 2019, Exxaro maintained an overall LTIFR of 0.12, above their target of 0.11.</p>



<p>“We remain determined to achieve zero harm in our operations. This includes focusing our efforts on health and safety measures that will ensure the well-being of our employees,” said Musa Mabasa, Matla Coal Mine’s acting business unit manager.</p>



<p>Mabasa stressed the importance of building a collaborative culture where every employee, no matter their job designation, is responsible for the safety and well-being of their colleagues. “When it comes to a risk-free work environment, we are all leaders, and all of us need to lead the way to safety excellence. I am incredibly proud of Matla’s Plant and CEWS teams for achieving yet another safety milestone. They continue to set the standard and raise the bar when it comes to safety performance,” Mabasa said. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Matla plant manager, Chris Welkom, also congratulated the teams on their hard work. “I would like to thank everyone for continuing to work safely and make safety their way of life in their various working areas. Let us continue with this attitude and determination as we aim for another year without LTI. Our next target is 1095 LTI free days.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Minerals Council South Africa&#8217;s (MCSA) CEO Zero Harm Forum has re-allocated research funding to focus on three COVID-19 related areas in the mining industry. </p>



<p>This was done after the Council recognised that fundamental research is critical to support the mining industry and others in dealing with the impact of COVID-19. “As healthcare professionals in this industry, we are continually learning about this disease and its impact,” said Dr Thuthula Balfour, head of health at the Minerals Council notes. She added that there was a particular focus to understand what makes people vulnerable and what we can do to prevent people from dying. “This is one of the most important reasons why the research we are undertaking is so important.”</p>



<p>“While the mortality rate in the mining industry is lower in the mining industry comparted to the rest of the country, we recognise that we are only seeing the initial impact of the pandemic in some regions and that it is likely that mining operations will be affected similarly to the regions in which we operate,” added.</p>



<p>The three research projects currently underway relate to understanding the nature of COVID-19, changing behaviours to stop the spread of the virus and a geographic information mapping system to enhance decision-making.</p>



<h5><strong>Research</strong></h5>



<p>The Minerals Council is collaborating with the Aurum Institute to conduct an analysis of the cases and deaths suffered until 20 June. This analysis will improve and accelerate learnings in support of the Minerals Council’s COVID-19 response and surveillance. The project comprises two phases aimed at reviewing and analysing the data currently collected by Minerals Council members, and reviewing the case files of up to 2 000 individuals who have tested positive across the mining industry to characterise the cases and determine similarities between different cases and possible areas of transmission and high risk.</p>



<p>The Minerals Council has also commissioned UNISA to conduct a study the effectiveness of all the control measures currently in place across the mining industry and whether these are achieving the intended objectives and what improvements are required.</p>



<h5><strong>Behaviour change</strong></h5>



<p>Work is underway with mining companies and behaviour change experts focussed on sharing and understanding leading practices and lessons to change behaviour among employees and in communities. Here, collective efforts are concentrated on researching healthy and safe behaviours to prevent and control COVID-19; identifying and assessing leading practices across the mining industry; and developing practical field guides to share the findings and improve our efforts.</p>



<p>This work will result in two field guides aimed at addressing behaviour and empowering employees with the necessary knowledge and self-awareness to be agents of change within their communities.</p>



<h5><strong>Geographic information mapping system</strong></h5>



<p>Given that COVID-19 is a geographic disease, the Minerals Council is in the process of developing and implementing a GIS system to inform decisions and mitigate the risks associated with transmission. The system outlines the prevalence of transmissions in communities and provides an overview of the coping mechanisms in place in different areas, such as hospitals and clinics.</p>



<p>“Ultimately, the research and work we are currently undertaking will be important to mining and beyond, adding to the fundamental knowledge of the disease and how to deal with it,” concluded Dr Balfour.</p>

<p>Goscor Earthmoving (GEM) has appointed Murray Leith as the new SANY operations manager. He will drive top-line growth across GEM’s new equipment sales, service and parts divisions.</p>



<p>“I am extremely optimistic about the SANY brand we represent, and look forward to growing this name in the South African market.” He will also build the SANY team and restructure its operating structure, with a dedicated focus on implementing the brand. Other operating efficiencies such as cost reductions and redirection will also be scrutinised closely.</p>



<p>“The continuing challenges we face are around product confidence, but as more customers are starting to use SANY machines, that confidence is growing. We see huge opportunity around our comprehensive product offering. From products to pricing, extended warranties, finance options and aftermarket support, we feel that our offering is superior to that of our competitors,” asserted Leith.</p>



<p>His career at GEM started in February 2018 as operations coordinator for SANY. Mainly dealing with the aftermarket division, Leith was tasked with implementing processes to drive aftermarket revenue and reduce costs.</p>



<p>Leith joined the sales team in June 2019. “By emphasising our enhanced product offering, aftermarket support and finance options, we managed to have a successful year with new SANY equipment sales.”</p>



<p>Being part of the Goscor Group is also helping to bolster the SANY brand in the marketplace. “We receive exceptional support from SANY, which allows us to be flexible in the way we trade. Our aim is to optimise customer profitability and provide a service that exceeds their expectations,” added Leith.</p>



<p>GEM is now 100% operational at Level 3 of the national lockdown, with a full staff complement at work. “We have been servicing our customers since the start of the lockdown, and will continue to do so,” said Leith. In addition, SANY has imported 15 000 face masks that will be distributed to GEM customers as additional support.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Mali Lithium has completed a new mineral resource estimate at its 100% owned Goulamina Lithium project in Mali, West Africa.</p>



<p>The new measured, indicated and inferred mineral resource estimate is 108.51 million tonnes at 1.45% Li₂O for 1.57 million tonnes contained Li₂O. Measured and Indicated Resources are 64.6 million tonnes at 1.49% Li₂Ofor 0.964 million tonnes of contained Li₂O.</p>



<p>The June 2018 Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resource estimate announced in the Pre-Feasibility Study (PFS) was 103.2 million tonnes at 1.34% Li2O for 1.39 million tonnes Li2O and included 43.7 million tonnes at 1.48% Li₂O of Indicated Mineral Resource.</p>



<p>“It is promising to see both the size and quality of the Goulamina Resources improve. This will provide the basis for an uplift in ore reserves. We will endeavour to complete the Ore Reserve and the Definitive Feasibility Study as soon as possible, now that COVID-19 delays are behind us,” commented Dr Alistair Cowden, Mali Lithium managing director.</p>



<p>The new resource represents a 48% uplift in measured and indicated resources. The Measured and Indicated Resources are the basis of a new ore reserve estimate being undertaken for the Goulamina Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS). A material improvement to PFS ore reserves and mine life is expected. The DFS will be completed in two months.</p>



<h5><strong>Resource Definition Drilling</strong></h5>



<p>A total of 445 RC and diamond drill holes for 52 012 metres have been drilled for resource and metallurgical, geotechnical, exploration and water exploration purposes at the Goulamina Lithium deposit to date.</p>



<p>During the 2019-2020 dry season, Mali Lithium drilled 36 RC drill holes for 6 842 metres for resource purposes into the Goulamina deposit. The drilling targeted areas where the previous pit optimisation was limited by the extent of the 2018 resource estimate in the Sangar l and Sangar ll domains, as well as infill drilling in the Danaya resource area.</p>



<p>The drilling program has successfully extended the Sangar l and Sangar ll spodumene pegmatites at depth and has extended the resources of those domains down dip. The interpreted domains in the north east part of the Goulamina deposit are organised into sub parallel mineralised lodes that dip 65 – 75 degrees towards the east northeast. Minor splays and linking structures are in evidence, though these are not generally modelled due to their sporadic and narrow nature.</p>



<p>At Danaya, infill drilling on three sections (12 RC drill holes), and interpretation of down hole acoustic imaging data that was received during the year, has resulted in a re-interpretation of the geology and orientation of pegmatites in that area. Consequently, the modelled resources in the area have been significantly modified. The resources published herein for Danaya have been tightly constrained and are considered conservative, particularly in areas of sparse drilling.</p>



<p>Weathered pegmatite material in all domains is excluded from all the Mineral Resource Estimates. Detailed metallurgical test-work on the generally low-grade weathered material has not been completed, but experience at other spodumene pegmatite operations point to poor product recoveries from the oxide zone which renders the oxidised pegmatites not economically treatable.</p>



<p>Resources in the Main, West l, and Sangar l domains that are supported by dense information have been upgraded to Measured Mineral Resources. The upgrade is based on the resolution of various issues highlighted in previous resource estimates. These included:</p>



<ul><li>Apparent high iron grades;</li><li>Anomalies in QAQC sampling; and</li><li>Dealing with wet samples while drilling</li></ul>

<p>Iron is a contaminant to the beneficiation process. The dominant cause of high iron results in previous assaying has been identified as the use of steel pulverising equipment to prepare samples for assay. The very hard spodumene material was causing accelerated wear to the equipment. This resulted in elevated iron grades. In this campaign, tungsten carbide bowls are used and result in lower iron contamination.</p>



<p>QAQC reference standards used in previous drilling campaigns were determined to be inappropriately selected for the sample digestion method used (sodium peroxide fusion). The certificates for these QAQC samples do not quote a reference grade for sodium peroxide fusion (this was due to the provider not having completed sufficient test work to establish a statistically meaningful expected value), and analysis of the QAQC results appeared to show a positive sample bias. The uncertified reference standards are useful in showing that the variation from the sample mean does not in general exceed 3 standard deviations and that there was no apparent assay drift in the 2017/2018 drilling campaign. In this campaign reference standards have been supplied by a different supplier and they are fit for purpose.</p>



<p>Additional compressor and booster capacity has been used in the 2019/2020 drilling campaign to assist with keeping samples dry. In some places where drilling intersects aquifers, lower lithium grades are most likely caused by chemical dissolution or degradation of the spodumene.</p>



<h5><strong>Exploration potential</strong></h5>



<p>There remains significant potential to further increase resources at Goulamina in the Danaya, and at depth in the Sangar zones.</p>



<p>The areas of highest potential for additional Indicated Mineral Resources are North and south of the Indicated mineral resources identified in the Danaya domain. A program of drilling to infill current drilling is expected to provide sufficient data to report a large increase in Indicated Resources. Timing of any further drilling is dependent on the results of the DFS.</p>

<p>Women have the potential to change the face and trajectory of the mining industry in South Africa. My view is that this is a change we should and need to support.</p>



<p>However, for women to meaningfully participate and contribute to the industry, we need it to be robust, and enabling for women to thrive.</p>



<p>There is a strong business case for gender diversity. A diverse workforce has been shown to create a more inclusive culture. Diverse people bring diversity of thought to organisations, which results in better decision-making, stronger governance and improved economic performance.</p>



<p>It is important for mining companies to create policies that drive a gender mix of new graduate intake and that women are given fair treatment when promotional opportunities arise in the workplace. It is also vital that the industry better promotes itself to students at school level before they reach university, so that a career in the mining industry is a consideration.</p>



<p>This is an excerpt of a foreword written by Thabile Makgala, who is the current chairperson of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://wimsa.org.za/" target="_blank">Women in Mining South Africa</a> (WiMSA).

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), the current COVID-19 outbreak has provoked social stigma and discriminatory behaviours against people of certain ethnic backgrounds as well as anyone perceived to have been in contact with the virus.</p>



<p>As part of its overall drive to fight COVID-19 and in the implementation of its <a href="https://bit.ly/33qIKKJ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10-point plan</a>, the Minerals Council South Africa (MSCA) and its members place a great deal of emphasis on education and communication both for employees and communities. Nationally and internationally the issue of stigmatisation of COVID-19 has significant ramifications for reporting, for behaviour and for people getting treatment. Stigmatisation is driven by fear, particularly the fear of the unknown.</p>



<p>In the mining industry the MCSA has recognised that stigmatisation has an impact at various levels. At a community level, stigmatisation may not only have an impact on the way in which mineworkers may be perceived in communities, but also in the way in individuals and groups within communities behave and are treated. Fear of stigmatisation may lead to irresponsible behaviour, such as people not wearing masks out of concern that they may be seen as being ill; not reporting when they are ill; and even not getting treatment when they need it which may result in complications and even death.</p>



<p>At a company level, stigmatisation could result in in a lack of support for individuals who are ill or apportioning blame to those who are infected as if their infection is something they brought upon themselves.</p>



<p>At an individual level, this could result in a lack of reporting by affected people for fear of discrimination and prejudice, as well as the denial of symptoms and risks. And, in some cases, could lead to irresponsible behaviour as individuals believe they will not be affected simply because of who they are, not how they behave.</p>



<p>To address the issue of stigma, the Minerals Council and its members have taken the following steps:</p>



<ul><li>Building trust in health services and company support mechanisms</li><li>Providing sufficient understandable and practical information in a non-judgmental and transparent way.</li><li>Showing empathy and care for those who are affected.</li><li>Providing practical avenues that individuals can and should follow to protect themselves and others, both in the prevention of illness and also in the event that they do contract the virus.</li></ul>

<h5><strong>MCSA members dealing with COVID-19 stigma</strong></h5>



<p>Some of the MCSA’s members shared some of the approaches that they are taking to dealing with stigma and risk behaviour. <a href="https://miningnews.co.za/2020/06/11/eradicating-covid-19-myths/">Exxaro Resources</a> shared examples of the company’s campaign to directly address stigma by focussing on 10 basic truths, and in so doing calling out myths. Some of these basic truths are:</p>



<ul><li>COVID-19 affects people of all ethnic groups</li><li>People of all ages can get seriously ill.</li><li>A face mask does not mean someone is infected.</li><li>You are no longer infectious once you have recovered.</li></ul>



<p>The campaign has not only been driven intensely within the company, but also in communities through street pole advertising. A further component on the campaign has been to use ‘real’ people as part of the initiative, including people with have been ill and recovered.</p>



<p>Seriti Resources shared details of the way in which the company sought to pre-empt any stigmatisation of employees who had recovered from COVID-19 when returning to work. The key messages of this campaign, led by the CEO, were to: remind everyone of the company’s core values; that virus is not picky and does not discriminate – anyone can get it; that finding cases early is a good thing and shows that the systems work; and that after 14 days of isolation, individuals will be virus free. This was supported by a range of materials – a brief, posters, meetings, and messaging on the company’s mobile app.</p>



<p>In its presentation Harmony Gold illustrated how it was dealing with the issue of quarantine, educating people within the company and in the community, what quarantine entailed, why it is necessary. Harmony’s programme included print material, live reads on radio and active engagement with individuals who were quarantined when they returned to work or as a result of contact tracing.</p>



<p>Lastly, Gold Fields’ South Deep mine spoke about the mine’s holistic and multi-platform approach to communication and education that encompasses the full life of an employee – at work, at home, in his/her community and while commuting. South Deep’s programme incorporates myth-busting and the provision of factual information and runs on a number of platforms – briefs, videos, posters, WhatsApp channel and Facebook. Importantly, it reaches out to and extends into the community, encouraging employees to be ambassadors and educators.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In March 2019, the European Commission announced its Circular Economy Action Plan as one of the main blocks of the European Green Deal. The plan focuses on the sectors that use most resources and where the potential for circularity is high, many of which rely on the mining industry for their raw materials.</p>



<p>The new EU action plan promotes the idea of a circular economy and fosters sustainable processes along the entire life cycle of products, aiming to ensure that the resources used remain in use for as long as possible.</p>



<p>Mining will play a vital role, as primary resources will continue to be needed due to the growing population and rising per capita consumption, and because it is impossible to close the loop. They are also used for modern applications in energy production and high-tech products. In addition, the sustainable development goals that the <a href="https://www.un.org/africarenewal/news/how-can-mining-contribute-sustainable-development-goals">United Nations have set up for 2030</a> are driving the development of green technologies that use a variety of minerals. Mining companies will have to adapt as their customers shift to a circular economy approach, and they will have a key role to play in this transition.</p>



<h5><strong>Challenges and opportunities for mining companies</strong></h5>



<p>The development of a circular economy in mining presents both challenges and opportunities for mining companies. It has the potential to address the shortage of mineral resources, waste of resources and environmental pollution while generating economic benefits.</p>



<p>The circular-economy approach prioritizes reusing materials over extracting new raw materials. However, the need for virgin materials remains, and wherever they are used, their footprint should be as small as possible.</p>



<p>Also, companies in all industries are under pressure to reduce their environmental impact. This will drive an increase in the demand for sustainably mined products, which poses a challenge for mining companies, but also opens new opportunities.</p>



<p>In order to reduce the footprint of the products they offer, mining companies will need to find ways to maximize the efficiency of their operations to minimize the use of energy and other inputs, while reducing waste as much as possible.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img src="https://miningnews.co.za/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/Mathilde-Robben_Key-Account-Manager-at-TOMRA-Sorting-Mining.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-38416" width="252" height="247" srcset="https://miningnews.co.za/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/Mathilde-Robben_Key-Account-Manager-at-TOMRA-Sorting-Mining.jpg 750w, https://miningnews.co.za/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/Mathilde-Robben_Key-Account-Manager-at-TOMRA-Sorting-Mining-300x294.jpg 300w, https://miningnews.co.za/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/Mathilde-Robben_Key-Account-Manager-at-TOMRA-Sorting-Mining-150x147.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 252px) 100vw, 252px" /><figcaption>Dr. Mathilde Robben is the key account manager at TOMRA Sorting Mining. <br><em>Credit: TOMRA Sorting Mining</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>According to Dr. Mathilde Robben,key account manager at TOMRA Sorting Mining, climate change and the pursuit of sustainable energy are shaping the global economy of the future, driving the transition from a linear to a circular economy model. She added that the mining industry is already adapting and shifting towards a green mining approach. As a large consumer of energy, water and chemicals, it is a prime example of a sector where much can be done to reduce the impact on the environment.</p>



<p>“However, it is vital that it achieves this move towards sustainable practices without losing sight of profitability. TOMRA’s advanced sensor-based sorting technologies address the main challenges the mining industry faces today, such as declining head-grades and increasingly difficult to access ore bodies, rising energy and labor costs, and increased environmental liability, while providing a highly cost-effective solution for mining operations to participate in the circular economy and make the most of the new opportunities it brings,” Robben said.</p>



<p>Sensor-based sorting technology can also significantly increase efficiency in terms of the input resources, such as energy, water and process reagents per ton of product. This significantly reduces the environmental footprint of the operation. Also, in an environment where competition for resources with other stakeholders such as communities and agriculture is increasingly fierce, this can become a driver to obtain the social license to operate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Grinding is the most energy-intensive part of the production process, and sensor-based sorting has been proven to reduce energy consumption by about half, with a consequent cut in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. It also results in a smaller footprint for the operation and reduces waste material.</p>



<p>Mining companies are rethinking their operating and business models to address the challenges of climate change and to meet the demands of their customers as they shift to circular economy models.</p>
